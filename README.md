# SpringAngular2TypeScript

This is an example of implementation of a 'Full Stack Web Application'.
Please note that this code is very experimental and continuosly modified.
AngularJS 2 is still in beta and the intregration of all the stack (using maven, grunt, bower, ...) is not stable yet.

- Spring Boot on the backend
- AngularJS 2 Beta on the frontend
- TypeScript as frontend language

It's mainly a test to verify the maturity of AngularJS 2 and how the technologies integrates together.
